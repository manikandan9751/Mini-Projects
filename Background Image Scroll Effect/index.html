        Nature is the interaction between living and non-living things in our physical surroundings, including the laws, elements, and phenomena of the physical world. It's the ultimate source of life, providing everything we need to survive, including oxygen, sunlight, soil, and water. Nature is also known as "Mother Nature" because it's always nurturing us, just like a mother.

        Nature is interdependent, with living and non-living things working together to maintain an ecological balance. For example, plants consume energy from sunlight, which is then used by herbivores, carnivores, and omnivorous animals. All species on Earth are important for the survival of the entire series of organisms and for balancing the natural cycle
